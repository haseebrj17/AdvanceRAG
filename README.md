# AdvanceRAG and Eval: Enhanced Document Retrieval and Evaluation

## Overview
"AdvanceRAG and Eval" is an advanced retrieval augmented generation project that utilizes the Llama_Index library for efficient document indexing and retrieval, coupled with TruLens for in-depth evaluation and performance tracking. This project targets the enhancement of information retrieval systems by implementing state-of-the-art technologies in natural language processing and machine learning.

## Project Description
This project is divided into two core components: 
1. **Document Indexing and Retrieval**: Using Llama_Index, the project creates an automated merging index from document collections, facilitating rapid and accurate retrieval of information.
2. **Performance Evaluation**: Leveraging TruLens, the system evaluates the retrieval performance, providing insights and metrics that help refine and optimize the retrieval process.

### Key Features
- **Automated Merging Index**: Constructs a hierarchical node structure from documents, enabling efficient query handling and data retrieval.
- **Embedding Models**: Utilizes embedding models such as BAAI's bge-small-en-v1.5 to transform text data into high-dimensional space, improving the semantic search capabilities.
- **Dynamic Retrieval**: Implements an AutoMerging Retriever that adjusts query processing based on the contextual relevance and node hierarchy.
- **Evaluation with TruLens**: Integrates TruLens to assess the quality of retrieval outputs, track system performance, and provide a leaderboard and dashboard for monitoring.

### Workflow
1. **Data Processing**: Documents are loaded and processed using a hierarchical node parser that segments the text into manageable chunks.
2. **Index Building**: An index is built using the processed nodes, allowing for quick retrieval of information through vector space mapping.
3. **Query Handling**: Incorporates a query engine that leverages the index to retrieve and rank the most relevant documents based on the user's query.
4. **Performance Tracking**: Uses TruLens to record and evaluate the retrieval results, giving feedback on the effectiveness of the retrieval strategies implemented.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **Llama_Index**: For building and managing the automated merging index.
- **TruLens**: For evaluating and visualizing the performance of the retrieval system.
- **OpenAI's GPT Models**: For generating embeddings and processing queries.
- **Python Libraries**: Including `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` for data manipulation and visualization.

## Conclusion
"AdvanceRAG and Eval" showcases a robust approach to document retrieval and evaluation, combining advanced indexing techniques with thorough performance analysis. This project sets the stage for further innovations in retrieval systems, making it a valuable tool for researchers and professionals in information management and retrieval.
